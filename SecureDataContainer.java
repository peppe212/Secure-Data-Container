    /*
      OVERVIEW: SecureDataContainer<E> is a container of objects of type E. Intuitively, the collection behaves like
                a Data Storage for storing and sharing data (represented in the simulation by
                objects of type E). The collection must guarantee a data security mechanism by providing its own
                user identity management mechanism. Furthermore, the collection must provide a mechanism of
                access control that allows the owner of the data to perform a selective and restrictive
                access to his data in the collection. Some users may be authorized by the owner
                to access the data, while others can not access it without authorization.

      Typical Element: Each user in the collection is associated with 0 or n Data elements
